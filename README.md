# CS-155-2017---Miniproject-1
Our Final submission for the first miniproject of cs 155. 

We had many other attempts at implementing other models, we did not
initially use Github to synchronize our work. For the purpose of
sharing code with TA's, we have included in this submission the 
implementations of our top 3 performing models, Deep Learning, 
Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Classifier with Logistic 
Regression.
